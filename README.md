# Overview
<br>
This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. The dataset was published in 1978 and has since been used extensively in machine learning education.

The dataset used (boston_housing.csv) contains 506 entries with 14 columns. Each row represents aggregated data about various features for houses in Boston.
Features include things like crime rate (CRIM), property tax rates (TAX), pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO), etc.
The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).

# Methods Used
<br>
Data preprocessing: Cleaning data, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and correlations between features.
<br>
Model selection: Trying out different regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
<br>
Model evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate and compare model performance.
<br>
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters using techniques like Grid Search Cross Validation.
